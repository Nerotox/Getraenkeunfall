# Getraenkeunfall

Getr√§nkeunfall is a drinking App available for Amazon Alexa and iOS.

This is the Repository for the iOS branch of the App.

Currently only available in German. (English version coming soon!)

### How to play
1. Press play.
2. Enter the names of all players.
3. Choose a gamemode.
4. Do whatever the rules tell you to do!

### Know Issues
* Formatting errors on IPhone SE on PlayMode screen (all other devices look great in all orientations)
* "GO PRO" button on the homescreen is still a Placeholder at this point. Was intended for monetization, but we got different plans for our business model right now.

### Tested Devices
* IPhone 6 Plus
* IPhone 6
* IPhone 7

### Limitations
We are using a Text To Speech Library provided by Apple. Therefore there might be some pronunciation errros (especially in german - the german ruleset will be reworked for release).
